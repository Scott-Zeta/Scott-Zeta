- 👨‍💻 About me: I am a recognition-driven person. I don't have a specific 'passion' or 'interest' in any particular area. What I hope is to utilize my skills and abilities to make things meaningful and helpful to at least some people in the world.
- 📆 Ongoing Porjects: Personal project [ICS Generator](https://github.com/Scott-Zeta/ICS_Generator)
  - This is my recent ambitious project, intended to solve real-world problems.
  - Meanwhile, it's a chance for me to acquire techniques I hadn't used before (already applied Django, Azure, and there will be more).
  - This time, I approached it in a professional way. I wrote down the Business Case, Plan, Architecture design, and my thoughts. Also, I logged every day I worked on the project and what I read.
- 📚 Ongoing Learning: Mainly focus on [DotNet ecosystem](https://github.com/Scott-Zeta/dotNetPlayground), perhaps nextstep Azure
  - I write down important things I learned, and insights I feel are valuable as notes, organized at different levels of the repo. My notes are more like a building progress of my understanding, not for frequent checks.
- 🎮 Devoting to my hobby: I make some mods for games I play. Check my [Steamworkshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198258857220/myworkshopfiles/) to see if there's one for what you play.
  - As with my core concept during work, I believe many problems can be caused by small glitches or poor design. So, my mods are usually not very complex or adding additional content, but mainly focus on problems that are small yet deadly to user experiences. I also believe simpler solutions are better solutions, so I always approach it in a way that has high compatibility and minimal impact.
