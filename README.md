- 👨‍💻 **About me**: I am a recognition-driven person. Although I don't have a specific 'passion' or 'interest' in a particular area, but I hope to utilize my skills and abilities to create things that meaningful and helpful to at least some people.
- 📆 **Ongoing Porjects**: Personal project [ICS Generator](https://github.com/Scott-Zeta/ICS_Generator). An ambitious initiative designed to tackle real-world challenges. This project serves as a platform for me to explore and integrate new technologies, including Django and Azure. I also use the it as a trainning to approach my work with professionalism, such as documenting everything from business cases and architectural designs to daily logs and reflections, doing more professional Testing by implementing test case.
- 📚 **Ongoing Learning**: I'm deeply engaged in mastering the [DotNet ecosystem](https://github.com/Scott-Zeta/dotNetPlayground), with plans to further delve into Azure. My repository is a dynamic space where I catalog crucial learnings and insights by notes, essentially mapping the evolution of my understanding.
- 🎮 **Devoting to my hobby**: Passionate about enhancing gaming experiences, I develop mods that address minor yet critical issues in games, optimizing user experience with simple, effective solutions. Check out my creations on my [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198258857220/myworkshopfiles/). I prioritize compatibility and minimal impact in my designs, reflecting my philosophy that the best solutions are often the simplest.
